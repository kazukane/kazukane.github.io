# Brief history
<b><i>Doctoral course, First post-doc</b></i><br>
I completed my medical degree in 2012 and PhD in 2016 at the University of Tsukuba, Japan.<br>
During my PhD and initial post-doc, I focused on the functional analysis of immunoreceptors using mouse models and cellular assays at [Akira Shibuya Lab](http://immuno-tsukuba.com/english/index.html). This includes extensive experience in **wet-lab techniques**, such as molecular biologies, cell cultures, animal models, and immune response studies (Kanemaru K et al., <b><i>Science Immunology</i></b>, 2019).<br>
<b><i>Second post-doc</b></i><br>
Since October 2020, at the [Sarah Teichmann Lab](https://www.teichlab.org/), I have been focusing on data generation/analysis of the human heart using **single-cell and spatial multiomics technologies**. I expanded my expertise towards a combination of wet-lab and dry-lab work: leveraging machine learning approaches and using cutting-edge genomics technologies to answer our biological questions and at the same time, advance method development in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. This allowed me to obtain biological insights directly from <i>in vivo</i> human tissues, and I was able to discover new cellular niches in the human heart (Kanemaru K and Cranley J et al., <b><i>Nature</i></b>, 2023).

# Vision
I am passionate about translating computational insights into practical applications within wet lab systems, where I can validate and further explore molecular mechanisms. My vision is to develop a powerful platform that seamlessly connects data analysis with experimental biology, enabling the rigorous testing of hypotheses derived from human data.
