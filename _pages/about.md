I completed my medical degree in 2012 and PhD in 2016 at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. 
During my PhD, I focused on the functional analysis of immunoreceptors using mouse models and cellular assays at [Akira Shibuya Lab](http://immuno-tsukuba.com/english/index.html). Since October 2020, I and have been a member of [Sarah Teichmann Lab](https://www.teichlab.org/) and focusing on data generation/analysis of the human heart using single-cell and spatial multiomics technologies.
